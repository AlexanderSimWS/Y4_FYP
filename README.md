# Analysis and Design of Lean Biomolecular Controllers Repo
Here you will find the supporting code for my Bioenineering Final Year project which is my last written coursework ever. I hope this code is helpful and that you might one day find inner peace as well.

## Overview
This project was about modelling and analysing genetic circuits with biomolecular controllers in the context of cellular resources. 3 main resources used in gene expression are analysed with mathematical and computational methods:
